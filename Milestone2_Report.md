# Process Scheduling Simulator Performance Report
CSEN602 - Milestone 2 - Team 1

## Introduction
This report documents the implementation and performance analysis of a process scheduling simulator that supports three scheduling algorithms: First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Round Robin (RR), and Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ). The simulator provides both a terminal-based interface and a graphical user interface (GUI) built with GTK4.

- RAM: 8GB unified memory
- Storage: 512GB SSD
- Operating System: macOS Sequoia 15.2

### Process Descriptions
1. Process 1 (File Operations)
   - Performs file read/write operations
   - Demonstrates I/O-bound behavior

2. Process 2 (User Input/Output)
   - Handles user input and output operations
   - Demonstrates interactive behavior

3. Process 3 (Computation)
   - Performs mathematical operations
   - Demonstrates CPU-bound behavior

## Performance Metrics

### Time Metrics
1. Release Time: Time when the process is created
2. Start Time: Time when the process begins execution

4. Execution Time: Total time spent executing
5. Waiting Time: Time between process creation and start of execution
6. Response Time: Time between process creation and first response
7. Turnaround Time: Total time from process creation to completion

### CPU Metrics
8. CPU Utilization: Percentage of time spent on CPU
9. CPU Useful Work: Percentage of CPU time spent on user code

### Memory Metrics
10. Memory Consumption: Memory usage in KB

## Analysis

### Time Metrics Analysis

1. Release Time, Start Time, and Finish Time:
   - Release Time is consistently 0.00ms as the reference point
   - Start Times show sequential patterns in all policies
   - Finish Times reflect the nature of each process's workload

2. Execution Time:
   - Process 2 shows consistent execution times (â‰ˆ2000ms) across policies
   - Process 1 and 3 have short execution times (0.02-0.05ms)
   - MLFQ shows slightly better execution time distribution

3. Waiting Time and Response Time:
   - MLFQ shows the lowest waiting times
   - RR provides balanced waiting times
   - FCFS shows increasing waiting times for later processes

4. Turnaround Time:
   - Process 2 dominates turnaround time due to I/O operations
   - MLFQ shows slightly better turnaround times for all processes
   - FCFS shows the highest variation in turnaround times

### CPU Performance Analysis

1. CPU Utilization:
   - FCFS shows highest overall CPU utilization
   - MLFQ provides balanced CPU utilization across processes
   - RR shows moderate CPU utilization

2. CPU Useful Work:
   - Process 3 shows highest CPU useful work across all policies
   - Process 2 shows minimal CPU useful work due to I/O operations
   - MLFQ shows better CPU useful work distribution

### Memory Usage Analysis

1. Memory Consumption:
   - FCFS shows lowest memory consumption
   - MLFQ requires slightly more memory than RR
   - Memory usage increases with scheduling complexity

## Conclusion

The comparison of FCFS, RR, and MLFQ scheduling policies reveals several key insights:

1. Performance Trade-offs:
   - FCFS provides highest CPU utilization but less fair process scheduling
   - RR offers balanced performance but higher overhead
   - MLFQ provides best overall performance with fair scheduling

2. Resource Utilization:
   - FCFS achieves highest CPU utilization
   - MLFQ shows best CPU useful work distribution
   - Memory consumption increases with scheduling complexity

3. Process Characteristics:
   - I/O-bound processes (Process 2) show similar performance across policies
   - CPU-bound processes (Process 3) benefit from MLFQ scheduling
   - Interactive processes (Process 1) perform best under MLFQ

4. Practical Implications:
   - For systems prioritizing CPU utilization: FCFS
   - For systems requiring fair scheduling: MLFQ
   - For systems with limited resources: FCFS
   - For interactive systems: MLFQ
